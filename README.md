# PAYROLL-MANAGEMENT-Cpp-
This project aims to develop a payroll and employee management system using the C++ programming language. The system will automate processes such as employee registration, attendance tracking, leave management, salary calculation, and salary slip generation. By streamlining these tasks, the system will enhance efficiency, minimize errors, and improve overall payroll management. The user-friendly interface and modular design of the system will contribute to increased productivity and reduced administrative workload.
